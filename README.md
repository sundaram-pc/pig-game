# pig-game
A web application implementing the old school pig game , designed using html,css and JavaScript
/*
GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls two dices as many times as he/she whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score i.e current score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1 in any of the two dice , all his ROUND score gets lost and if both the dice shows 6 then the entire 
score is lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his net score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on net score wins the game.
-The players can set and change the winning score at any point of the game.
